description=\n\
The storescp application implements a Service Class Provider (SCP) for the \
Storage Service Class. It listens on a specific TCP/IP port for incoming \
association requests from a Storage Service Class User (SCU) and can receive \
DICOM images and other DICOM Composite Objects. The storescp application also \
supports the Verification Service Class as a SCP.\n\-\n\

Example: storescp -b STORESCP:11112\n\
=> Starts server listening on port 11112, accepting association requests with \
STORESCP as called AE title. Received objects are stored to the working directory.
accept-unknown=accept unknown SOP Class; otherwise only Storage SOP Classes \
specified by resource:sop-classes.properties or --sop-classes are accepted
sop-classes=file path or URL of list of accepted SOP Classes, \
resource:sop-classes.properties by default
status=specifies status code in returned C-STORE RSPs, 0000H by default.
ignore=do not store received objects in files
directory=directory to which received DICOM Composite Objects are stored, \
'.' by default
filepath=file path of stored objects, '{ggggeeee}' will be replaced by the \
attribute value, e.g.: '{00100020}/{0020000D}/{0020000E}/{00080018}.dcm' will \
store received objects using the SOP Instance UID (0008,0018) as file name and \
'.dcm' as file name extension into sub-directories structured according its \
Patient ID (0010,0020), Study Instance UID (0020,000D} and Series Instance UID \
(0020,000E). At default, received objects are stored to the storage directory \
with the SOP Instance UID (0008,0018) as file name without extension.
